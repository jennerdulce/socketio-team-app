LAB 14: Event Driven Applications
Codefellows 401 JavaScript

Project: Socket-io Team App

Overview
Spent 2 days collaborating to create a chatroom and speed typing minigame. From a central server socket, multiple clients are able to join over a hosted network. Upon connection, each client is able to assign themselves a username which is displayed upon any message input into the terminal. This message is sent to the server, then bounced back to all clients currently connected, creating a realtime messaging service. 

Features:
an event listener tracks certain commands able to be entered by the user:

data(dev command) - displays to the server information about the current server, who is playing, all clients' usernames, and current scores of all players.
start - any user may enter start to begin the speed typing mini game. after a short countdown, a tongue twister is sent to all players connected to the current space.wWhomever types the response that matches the displayed message the fastest wins a point for that round. After one player has earned three points, they are declared the winner.
terminal is cleared of entered text and output from previous game rounds to keep a clean looking display for better user experience.
